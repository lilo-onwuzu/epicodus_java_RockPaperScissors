#### _Description_
	This site presents a game of Rock Paper Scissors.
	User can play with another user or with random moves (rock, paper, or scissors) from the computer.
	Rock beats scissors. Scissors beat paper. Paper beats rock. Ties play again.
	Restful web pages are routered and rendered through the Spark Framework. 
	Velocity tool is used to create html (with lightweight java code) templates for our Spark routines (get/post etc).
	VelocityTemplateEngine is used as an adapter to add Velocity templates to our Spark routines.	
	The code was designed using Behavoir Driven Development (BDD) testing principles. 
	The unit testing of the backend is done using jUnit. 
	The integration testing of the user interface was done using Selenium Webdriver tests and a FluentLenium Adapter. 
	All testing dependencies were managed using Gradle. 
	No database backing.

#### _Setup/Installation Requirements_
